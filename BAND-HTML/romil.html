                            Born and raised in South Windsor, Connecticut, Romil began producing music in his bedroom as he cited it as his "little save haven". In 2015, Romil met the members of "ALIVESINCEFOREVER" through the internet forum "KanyeToThe" and soon later make the move to Texas to help produce tracks for Dom McLennon's "Sandy Shore Motel" mixtape and every track on Kevin Abstract's debut album "MTV1987".

                            Hemnani also released his debut EP "Memorial Day" featuring Kevin Abstract and bearface under the moniker "NOWIFII" in the same year. After the group re-branded themselves as "BROCKHAMPTON" and moved to Los Angeles, Romil continues to be one of their three main producers alongside production duo "Q3" (Jabari Manwa and Kiko Merley) while also being a producer for a majority of the band members' solo projects. In 2018, he was credited as a co-producer and songwriter for the track "Just a Stranger" from singer Kali Uchis' album "Isolation".
